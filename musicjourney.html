  My music journey began when I was one year old. I would go to a music program called 
  <a href="kindermusik.html">Kindermusik</a>. I continued with this program until I was three years old. It was fun until my parents decided not to go with me one day; I could not stop screaming and crying for my parents to come back. This resulted in the end of my Kindermusik era. 
</p>

<p>A few years later, I found interest in playing the piano. I would jam on my 
    <a href="piano.html" rel= "stylesheet"> piano everyday from 6-13 years old.</p>
