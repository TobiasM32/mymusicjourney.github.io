        <h1>The Story of My Music Journey</h1>

    <main>
<p>
  My music journey began when I was one year old. I would go to a music program called 
  <a href="kindermusik.html">Kindermusik</a>. I continued with this program until I was three years old. It was fun until my parents decided not to go with me one day; I could not stop screaming and crying for my parents to come back. This resulted in the end of my Kindermusik era. 
</p>

<p>
  A few years later, I found interest in playing the piano. Everyday from ages 6–13, I would jam on my 
  <a href="piano.html">piano</a>. Though I don't know the exact number, I'd say I learned more than 30 songs. However, I eventually stopped playing because I would rather play video games or talk to friends.
</p>
<p>
    In high school, I got back into music. I started playing the piano again, and I learned how to play the 
    <a href= "violin.html">violin</a>. I had other friends who also liked music, so we would jam everyday at school, and perform for fun. We still jam for fun to this day.
